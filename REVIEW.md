Close the PATH inline code span

The inline code fence on the PATH tip never closes, so the remainder of the paragraph renders as code. Add the trailing backtick after the command to fix the Markdown.

In README.md around lines 45 to 46, the inline code span for the PATH example is missing a closing backtick which causes the rest of the paragraph to render as code; fix this by adding a trailing backtick after export PATH=$PATH:. so the inline code is properly closed and the following text renders normally.

Comment:
--show-elapsed false currently triggers positional-arg error

Our flag-reordering step only treats flags with non-boolean defaults as expecting a value, so when a user tries to disable any of the new default-true switches with a space-separated boolean (e.g. pbar --show-elapsed false 50 100), the false token falls through as a positional argument and we bail out with “provide both current and total values.” The same regression hits --show-throughput false and --show-eta false. We need to recognize explicit boolean tokens during reordering and attach them to their flags. 

            if i+1 < len(args) && !strings.HasPrefix(args[i+1], "-") {
-               // Check if this flag expects a value
-               flagName := strings.TrimPrefix(strings.TrimPrefix(arg, "-"), "-")
-               if flag.Lookup(flagName) != nil && flag.Lookup(flagName).Value.String() != "true" && flag.Lookup(flagName).Value.String() != "false" {
-                   i++                            // Move to flag value
-                   flags = append(flags, args[i]) // Add flag value
-               }
+               next := args[i+1]
+               flagName := strings.TrimPrefix(strings.TrimPrefix(arg, "-"), "-")
+               if f := flag.Lookup(flagName); f != nil {
+                   if next == "true" || next == "false" {
+                       i++
+                       flags = append(flags, next)
+                   } else if f.Value.String() != "true" && f.Value.String() != "false" {
+                       i++
+                       flags = append(flags, next)
+                   }
+               }
            }

Prompt for AI Agent:
In main.go around lines 64 to 116, the reordering logic drops space-separated boolean tokens (e.g. "--show-elapsed false") as positional args; modify the check that decides whether the next token is a flag value so it also accepts explicit boolean tokens "true" or "false". Concretely, after determining flagName and confirming flag.Lookup(flagName) != nil, treat the next arg as the flag value if it does not start with "-" and (the flag expects a non-boolean value OR the next token equals "true" or "false"); then consume that token into flags as the flag value. Ensure existing handling of "--flag=value" remains unchanged.

## Comprehensive Codebase Review (September 2025)

### 1. General Observations & Architecture

The codebase is well-structured, separating core progress bar logic (`pbar/pbar.go`), parallel management (`pbar/manager.go`), color handling (`pbar/colors.go`), and the CLI entry point (`main.go`). The recent addition of state management for persistence is a significant feature enhancement.

### 2. Areas of Excellence

*   **Core Logic (`pbar/pbar.go`):** The progress bar rendering logic is robust, handling edge cases like `Total=0` and `Current > Total` gracefully. The implementation of `renderBrailleBar` is a high-quality feature, correctly calculating fractional fill using Braille characters.
*   **Concurrency (`pbar/manager.go`):** Correct use of `sync.Mutex` for thread-safe updates in parallel mode. The ANSI escape code logic for clearing and re-rendering multiple lines is correctly implemented for dynamic CLI output.
*   **State Management:** The use of `SaveState` and `LoadState` for persistence is well-implemented within the `pbar` package, ensuring continuity of `StartTime`, `PreviousCurrent`, and `ThroughputHistory`.

### 3. Potential Improvements & Bugs

| File | Line(s) | Issue/Improvement | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `main.go` | 113-152 | **Fragile Flag Parsing** | The custom logic to reorder `os.Args` before `flag.Parse()` is complex and prone to errors, as noted by the existing CodeRabbit review. Consider replacing with a robust CLI library (e.g., `cobra` or `cli`) for better argument handling. |
| `main.go` | 258-262 | **State Loading Error** | If `pbar.LoadState(instanceID)` fails (e.g., state file not found), `main.go` currently exits with an error. For a new or resumed bar, it should gracefully fall back to initializing a new `pbar.Bar` if the state file is missing, rather than exiting. |
| `main.go` | 43-82 | **Instance ID Fragility** | `generateInstanceID` manually excludes flags like `current`, `total`, and `message`. This is fragile. If new dynamic flags are added, they must be manually excluded. A more declarative approach is recommended. |
| `pbar/pbar.go` | 104-106 | **Unnecessary Sleep** | The `time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)` on the first render is a hack to allow for throughput calculation. This should be handled by ensuring `LastUpdateTime` is set correctly on initialization and by checking if `time.Since(b.LastUpdateTime)` is zero before calculating `deltaTime`. |
| `pbar/pbar.go` | 144-145 | **Throughput Calculation** | The throughput calculation uses `deltaCurrent` and `deltaTime` since the *last update*. This is correct for instantaneous throughput, but the average is calculated over `ThroughputHistory`. The reliance on `time.Sleep` in `main.go` for the first render is a concern. |
